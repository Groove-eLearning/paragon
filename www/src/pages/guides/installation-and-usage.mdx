# Installation and usage

Paragon components require React 16 or higher. To install Paragon into your project:

Install paragon and its peer depedencies:

```
npm i --save @edx/paragon @emotion/react
```

In your React project, wrap the root of the app with `ParagonProvider`. ParagonProvider provides locale and theme information to components. If no theme or locale is set Paragon will use a default theme and "en-us" as the locale. The theme object must conform to the [system-ui theme specification](https://system-ui.com/theme).

```jsx
// index.js

ReactDOM.render(
  <ParagonProvider theme={theme} locale="en-us">
    ...the app
  </ParagonProvider>
);
```

Import components from `@edx/paragon`.

```jsx
// page.js

import { Button } from '@edx/paragon';

// ...

render() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary">Click me!</Button>
  );
}
```

#### SCSS Foundation

Usage with no theme:

```scss
@import "@edx/paragon/scss/core/core.scss";
```

Usage with a theme:

```scss
@import "@my-brand/fonts.scss";
@import "@my-brand/variables.scss";
// Import the Paragon core after setting brand-themed variables.
@import "@edx/paragon/scss/core/core.scss";
// Import brand overrides after the Paragon core.
@import "@my-brand/overrides.scss";
```

Note that including fonts will affect load performance.  In some pages you may choose not to load the custom font.
